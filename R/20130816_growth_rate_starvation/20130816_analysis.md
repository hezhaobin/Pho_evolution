Growth curve analysis | data: 08/17/2013
========================================================
This script does some data plotting and quality check
for my first Bioscreen-C experiment

Read data
------------------
Notes:  
* change the working directory
* replace the filename with the appropriate name

```r
raw <- read.csv("BioscreenExperiment20130816.csv")
# note: each column is temporal data for one well
data <- as.matrix(raw[, -1])
```


Design matrix
------------------
* define the strains
* define all factors involved
* setup the design matrix

```
## Strains
```

```
## [1] "wt"             "pho80-1"        "pho80-2"        "pho4"          
## [5] "pho80.scPho4-1" "pho80.scPho4-2" "empty"
```

```
## Each strain is tested in the following 10 conditions
```

```
##    Glucose    Pi Rapamycin
## 1       2%  10mM    0ng/ml
## 2       2%   1mM    0ng/ml
## 3       2% 0.1mM    0ng/ml
## 4       2%   0mM    0ng/ml
## 5     0.5%  10mM    0ng/ml
## 6     0.5%   1mM    0ng/ml
## 7     0.5% 0.1mM    0ng/ml
## 8       2%  10mM   10ng/ml
## 9       2%  10mM   50ng/ml
## 10      2%   1mM   10ng/ml
```


Functions
-----------------
1. Subfunction to summarize the data by calculating the mean and sd of tech. repl.



2. A function to visualize the time course for any given strain at a particular condition



3. Based on plotTrace, but plot the mean of tech. repl.



Analyses
-----------------
### 1. Quality check
#### _Negative controls_
The last well of each column has no cells in it. Plotting the OD of the 20 empty wells should be background.

```r
x = myMeanSD(data, design.mat)
plotMeanTrace(x, "empty", 1:10, title = "Empty wells", lwd = 1.5)
```

#### _But something is wrong with the first column_
Notice the flat line including the wt, the two pho80 strain, all of which are in the first column
Also notice that the rest three strains shared a similar pattern, i.e. there is a peak at ~6h, then a drop, followed by a recovery. In the case of pho80.scPHO4, there is a subsequent drop. The _pho4_ strain seems to do particularly well in this condition. By the end it still doesn't seem to saturate.  

```r
plotMeanTrace(x, "all", 1, lwd = 1.5, title = "First column problem")
```

#### _Starved for Pi_
The biological replicates (pho80 and pho80.scPHO4) are quite similar. From now on I just plot one of them

```r
st.use <- c("wt", "pho80-1", "pho4", "pho80.scPho4-1")
layout(matrix(c(1, 2), ncol = 2))
plainMeanTrace(x, st.use, c(2:3), lwd = 1.5, title = "Low Pi")
plainMeanTrace(x, st.use, 4, lwd = 1.5, title = "No Pi")
```

#### _Starved for Glucose (and Pi)_

```r
layout(matrix(c(1, 2), ncol = 2))
plainMeanTrace(x, st.use, 5, lwd = 1.5, ylim = c(0.06, 1.2), title = "Low Glucose")
plainMeanTrace(x, st.use, c(6, 7), lwd = 1.5, ylim = c(0.06, 1.2), title = "Low Glucose + Low Pi")
```

#### _Comparison grouped by strains, not conditions_

```r
layout(matrix(c(1:4), byrow = TRUE, ncol = 2))
plainMeanTrace(x, "wt", 1:7, lwd = 1.5, ylim = c(0.06, 1.2), title = "wt")
plainMeanTrace(x, "pho80-1", 1:7, lwd = 1.5, ylim = c(0.06, 1.2), title = "pho80")
plainMeanTrace(x, "pho80.scPho4-1", 1:7, lwd = 1.5, ylim = c(0.06, 1.2), title = "pho80.scPho4")
plainMeanTrace(x, "pho4", 1:7, lwd = 1.5, ylim = c(0.06, 1.2), title = "pho4")
```
