Pho-In-silico
=============
This is a repo to deposit analyses I did for the PHO pathway evolution project done in the O'Shea lab at Harvard University.

The goal of the project is to understand the mechanism, consequences and potential evolutionary explanation of a regulatory change in the phosphate starvation response pathway between two yeast species.
